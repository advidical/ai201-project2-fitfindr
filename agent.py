"""
The FitFindr planning loop.

This is the file that makes FitFindr an agent rather than a script. It decides
which tool to run next based on what the last one returned.

If your loop calls all three tools no matter what comes back, you have a list
of function calls. A loop looks at the last result before it picks the next
step. **That branch is the graded part of this unit.**

Build and test your three tools in `tools.py` first. Then come here.

    python agent.py          runs both example paths below

    A fresh session for one user interaction.

    The session is the single source of truth for a run. Every tool result goes
    in here, and the next tool reads it back out.

    You could pass values straight from one call to the next. It would work,
    and you would not be able to test it — you can't print a variable you have
    already overwritten. Going through the session is what makes the state
    visible, and unit 4 has you write a criterion about exactly that.

    Add fields if you need them.

    IN UNIT 4 you come back and add two things:

      • Trace calls. One per step. `trace.step("search_listings", inputs=...,
        returned=...)` — see trace.py. Your README needs the output.

      • A handler for ModelUnavailable, so a bad key produces a message rather
        than a stack trace. The import is already at the top of this file.
